# Architectural Concept Register

Review status: reviewed for canonical release v4.5.9.

## Accepted Concepts

### Situation Space

The structured set of possible situations relevant to autonomous work. It contains entities, states and relationships rather than merely an inventory of nearby objects. Environmental influences such as weather belong within Situation Space rather than requiring a separate Conditions concept.

### Current Situation

The system's present estimated point within Situation Space. It is knowledge reconstructed from observations, not Reality itself. The existing term `Operational Picture` remains in use while the vocabulary relationship is reviewed.

### Future Space

The set of plausible future situations currently under consideration. It deliberately preserves multiple possibilities rather than treating one prediction as certain.

### Action Space

The set of actions currently available to an entity or system. Anticipation is valuable because it preserves Action Space before options collapse.

### Situation Assessment

The transformation that interprets observations and maintains the most plausible Current Situation. It represents evolving risk, uncertainty, constraints and permitted responses; it does not issue control commands.

### Commitment

A persistent intention to perform an action. Commitment owns creation, maintenance, completion and cancellation. Situation Assessment may provide evidence that a commitment remains valid or should end, but does not continuously replace it with each new observation.

### Conflict Zone

A derived operational concept: a spatial-temporal region in which intended motion cannot safely coexist without coordination. It remains useful for describing elevated interaction risk, but is no longer treated as a root architectural primitive.

## Deferred Concepts

### Opportunity

Useful descriptive language for a possible pre-commitment course of action, but current evidence does not show an independent lifecycle or responsibility. Reconsider when observations reveal competing intentions that must persist or be governed before Commitment exists.

### Entity Naming

The architecture requires a general participant concept broader than a vehicle or worker. `Entity` is the current candidate label, but naming remains Deferred until the concept's boundary is demonstrated consistently.

### Repository Folder Numbering

The existing numbered structure is retained. Reconsider only when evidence identifies a navigation or continuity problem that a numbering change would solve.

### Operational Picture versus Current Situation

The two terms may describe the same maintained knowledge. Keep both under review until ownership, lifecycle or explanatory difference is demonstrated.

## Rejected Concepts

### Conditions

Rejected as a separate architectural concept because weather and comparable environmental influences already belong within Situation Space. Reconsider only if an independent lifecycle or responsibility is observed.

## Architectural Dimensions and Distinctions

### Reality and Knowledge

Reality exists independently of the system. Knowledge is the system's evolving estimate reconstructed from observations. This distinction is architectural knowledge rather than an independently owned component.

### Time

Time is the dimension in which Reality evolves, observations occur, Knowledge changes, Future Space is reconsidered and Action Space expands or collapses. It is not another processing component.

## Review Rule

At every canonical release, review all sections against current evidence. Promotion, deferral, rejection or demotion requires a recorded rationale in `DECISION_LOG.md` or an ADR. An unchanged review is still recorded in the release changelog.
